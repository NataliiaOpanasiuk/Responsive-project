            <h2>WHY PORT MCNEILL?</h2>
            <h3>Gateway to the Broughton Archipelago</h3>
            <p>
              Known as the entry point to the Broughton Archipelago's
              breathtakingly beautiful islands, protected areas, and winding
              waterways, Port McNeill is a grade-A first step towards outside
              exploration. The second-largest settlement on Vancouver Island
              North coexists peacefully with the abundant marine and terrestrial
              natural resources. Its proximity to the best island gems on the
              east coast, four hours' drive from Nanaimo's ferry terminals, and
              its two hours' drive from Campbell River make it a regional hub
              for ecotourism, which includes whale watching, grizzly bear
              safaris, diving, sea kayaking, and fresh and saltwater fishing.

              <h4>Telegraph Cove</h4>
              <p>
                Telegraph Cove grew from a fishing and canning village into an
                eco-tourism hub attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors
                each year. Even though Telegraph Cove only has about 20
                year-round inhabitants, this small village has much to offer.

                Located within the traditional territory of the Kwakiutl First

                Vancouver Island, Port Hardy and the surrounding area is rich in
                tradition and deep-rooted in culture. Totems and big houses
                stand tall and weathered throughout Port Hardy and the
                neighbouring community of Fort Rupert, telling of the indigenous
                history that began over 8,000 years ago.
